# NLP_Final_Project
A project to recognize images with signs from American Sign Language.
It contains setup files and a file with license.
Most importantly it contains a "model.h5" file which contains a deeplearning model and
a "predict.py" file to run in order to predict signs on images.
If you run this file you will be asked to enter a path to your image.
Please remember to check if you entered a correct path.
There is also one image added to the package.
If you don't have your own images you can use this one to check if everything is working.
Outside of this package are also added two other .ipynb files.
The "The_model.ipynb" file contain code that I used to create model.h5.
The "Evaluation.ipynb" file contains evaluation of model with graphs and short comments.
