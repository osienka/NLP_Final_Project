# NLP_Final_Project
A project to recognize images with signs from American Sign Language.
It contains setup files and a file with license.
Most importantly it contains a "model.h5" file which contains a deeplearning model and
a "predict.py" file to run in order to predict signs on images.
If you run this file you will be asked to enter a path to your image.
Please remember to check if you entered a correct path.
There is also one image added to the package.
If you don't have your own images you can use this one to check if everything is working.
Outside of this package are also added two other .ipynb files.
The "The_model.ipynb" file contain code that I used to create model.h5.
It should be considered just as a readible file just to get an idea how the model was done and what the metrics are.
It contains the evaluation of the model with graphs and comments. 
It offers the option to predict your own data but it requiers some path changes so it is preferable to use the package for that purpose.
Please use it as a colab or jupyter notebook or just read it as it is in the repository.
